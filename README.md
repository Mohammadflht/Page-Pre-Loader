# Page-Pre-Loader
a simple page pre-loader for a page with fake &lt;iframe> HTML tag  to make the website busy to see pre-loader 

### Note :
> Because the website is not busy at the moment, it is not easy to recognize the pre loader page, 
that's why I used a series of <iframe> tag to make the site look busy(fake) so that it is easier to see the pre loader.
